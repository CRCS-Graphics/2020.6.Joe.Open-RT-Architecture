# A user programmable ray-tracing framework for Unity
In this project, we will design and implement a ray-trace framework based on programming models presented by modern commodity GPUs. The framework will define and support replaceable processing modules in ray-tracing, such as ray generation, ray-object intersections, and illumination. The framework will be designed and implemented targeting general-purpose commodity GPUs and does not require special-purpose hardware. This feature will enable platform portability. 

## Objectives
- Design and implement a ray-tracing framework on the Unity 3D engine. This framework will allow users to program various ray-tracing modules.

- Implement a collection of the modules to demonstrate the feasibility and modularity of the framework and assess the performance of the framework.
